## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can run the Real Estate Price Predictor, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-estate-price-predictor.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd real-estate-price-predictor
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the Real Estate Price Predictor, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your real estate data in a CSV file with the necessary features. You can use the provided sample dataset for reference.

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook `RealEstatePricePredictor.ipynb`.

3. Follow the notebook instructions to load your data, preprocess it, train machine learning models, and make price predictions.

4. Customize the model parameters, feature selection, and evaluation metrics according to your specific needs.

## Data

The Real Estate Price Predictor uses real estate data to make predictions. You can either use your own dataset or explore the sample dataset provided in the `data` directory. Make sure your dataset includes relevant features such as:

- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Square footage
- Neighborhood
- Year built
- Lot size
- Etc.

## Models

This project includes several machine learning models for real estate price prediction, including:

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Neural Network (Deep Learning)

You can choose the model that best fits your data and requirements. Additionally, you can explore and experiment with other regression algorithms as needed.

## Evaluation

We have provided evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the models, including:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared (RÂ²)

You can select the evaluation metric that suits your analysis goals. These metrics will help you gauge the accuracy and reliability of the price predictions.
